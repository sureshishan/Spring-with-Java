/*
 * When runtime environment observes an unhandled unchecked exception object in
 * a method the the runtime environment will forcibly remove that method from
 * the stack.
 * 
 * By default the method will be removed from the stack one it is completed
 * executing the last line successfully or closing brace of the method is
 * reached.
 * 
 * in this case the exception object will be propagated from called place to the
 * calling place.
 * 
 * when there is unhandled unchecked exception object then runtime environment
 * will remove the method from the stack and it propagate the exception object
 * from the called place to the calling place.
 * 
 * the if the runtime environment receives unhandled exception object it will
 * block the process of execution.
 * 
 * This process of propagating the exception from called place to calling place
 * is called as "Ducking"
 * 
 * in case of unchecked exception we need not to write any code to propagate an
 * exception from called place to calling place. This will be automatically done
 * in case of unchecked exceptions. it is also called as auto ducking.
 * 
 * forcibly removing the method from the stack is called as stack unwinding when
 * an unhandled unchecked exception is observed by the runtime environment.
 * 
 * because of stack unwinding there is automatic ducking in unchecked
 * exceptions.
 * 
 * 
 * checked exception will not be propagated automatically. there is no concept
 * of auto ducking in case of checked exceptions.
 * 
 * so how i can propagate the checked exception from called place to calling
 * place?
 * 
 * we need to write some code to propagate the checked exception from called
 * place to calling place.
 * 
 * what do you think is the advantage of decking.
