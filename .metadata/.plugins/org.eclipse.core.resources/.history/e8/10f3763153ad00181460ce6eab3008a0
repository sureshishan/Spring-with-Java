/*
 * If the overriding is initiated and the rules are not satisfied then it is a
 * compile time error
 * 
 * Compiler will not check to which object it is referring to but to the data
 * type of the reference
 * 
 * Compiler will never check what is the Object only it checks the type of the
 * reference.
 * 
 * because of dynamic binding polymorphism occurs.
 * 
 * 
 * In Java without inheritance can i have polymorphism? No. without inheritance
 * there is no concept of polimorphism. and it happens only when Dynamic binding
 * happens
 * 
 * Only can have dynamic binding attributes will have only static binding, so
 * the attributes point to the members of the reference only even at runtime.
 * 
 * If you try to refe the attribute using reference variable it bind to the attribute in the reference call onlyF
